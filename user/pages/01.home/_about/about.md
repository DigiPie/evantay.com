## Aspiring full-stack software engineer

Hi, I am a penultimate Computer Science undergraduate and aspiring full-stack developer passionate about solving meaningful problems.

I am an [IMDA](https://www.imda.gov.sg) scholar (bond-free) who has received numerous academic and leadership awards. I was awarded the Colours Award for my contributions to the NUS recreational sports scene as the [President of the NUS Inline Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/?hl=en).

I believe social growth is just as important as academic development. As a [CS1010: Programming Methodology](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1010/programming-methodology) tutor, I conducted weekly 2-hour tutorial sessions for 14 students. As the current [Deputy Head of Technology of NUS's Google Developer Student Club](https://dscnustech.github.io), I oversee the execution of technical events organised by the club.

In my free time, I read, do endurance running and learn new things. Currently, I am taking the online Udemy course: [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WPmCEoceF5UQ3g=/).
