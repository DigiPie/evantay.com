## Aspiring full-stack software engineer
Hi, I am a penultimate Computer Science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) who is passionate about full-stack development and cloud system administration. I am an [IMDA](https://www.imda.gov.sg) scholar (bond-free) who has received various awards and prizes during my past diploma and present university course.

I believes social growth are just as important as academic development. I was awarded the Colours Award for my contributions to the NUS recreational sports scene as the [president of the NUS Inline Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/?hl=en). I was also a tutor for [CS1010: Programming Methodology](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1010/programming-methodology) and [CS2030: Programming Methodology 2](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2030/programming-methodology-ii).

In my free time, I take online courses (most recently, [HarvardX's Data Science: R Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics)), practice Vinyasa yoga and train for endurance running.

## Looking for summer internship in 2020
I am looking for a software engineering or cloud-operation internship from 11 May to 31 Aug 2020 where I will get to work on meaningful problems in a collaborative environment. During this internship, I hope to receive guidance from mentors who would challenge me to grow as a tech professional.

If you think I could be a good fit for your company, do reach out to me via [email](mailto:evantay@comp.nus.edu.sg), view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanitsg/) or check out my [Github page](https://github.com/DigiPie). A generic resume is also available below.
