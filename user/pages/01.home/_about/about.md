## Aspiring full-stack software engineer
Hi, I am a penultimate Computer Science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) who is passionate about full-stack development and cloud system administration. I am an [IMDA](https://www.imda.gov.sg) scholar (bond-free) who has won various awards and competitions during my past diploma education and present university course.

I believe social and physical growth are just as important as academic development. I was the [president of the NUS Inline Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/?hl=en), and a tutor for [CS1010: Programming Methodology](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1010/programming-methodology) and [CS2030: Programming Methodology 2](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2030/programming-methodology-ii). I also practice yoga and am currently training to run my first-ever marathon in mid-2020.

## Looking for internship in 2020
I am looking for a 3-months internship from 11 May to 31 August 2020. I am interested in full-stack development and looking for an intership where I will get to solve difficult problems in a collaborative and agile environment under a mentor who would challenge me to grow as a tech professional.

Do reach out to me at [evantay@comp.nus.edu.sg](mailto:evantay@comp.nus.edu.sg) or view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanitsg/).
