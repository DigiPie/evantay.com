## Aspiring full-stack software engineer

Hi, I am a Computer Science undergraduate and aspiring full-stack developer passionate about solving meaningful problems. This summer, I am doing a Software Engineer internship at [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/), and taking part in the [Google Cloud Student Sprint Program](https://events.withgoogle.com/cssp/).

I believe social growth is just as important as academic development. As a [tutor for CS1010: Programming Methodology](https://github.com/DigiPie/CS1010-Tutorial-C09), I conducted weekly tutorials for 14 students independently. As the [Deputy Head of Technology at Developer Student Club NUS](https://dscnustech.github.io), I co-organised and emceed for the first-ever Hack For Good hackathon.

I am also an [IMDA scholar (bond-free)](https://www.imda.gov.sg) who has received numerous academic and leadership awards. I was awarded the Colours Award for my contributions to the recreational sports scene as the [President of the NUS Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/).

In my free time, I run, read and learn new things. The latest online course I completed is the Udemy course: [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-e3c08245-a935-45b7-91da-6cc690f3dd30/?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email).
