## Aspiring full-stack software engineer
Hi, I am a year 3 computer science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) who is passionate about full-stack development and cloud system administration. I am an IMDA scholar who has won various awards during my past diploma education and present university course.

I believe social and physical growth are just as important as academic development. I am the current [president of the NUS Skating Club](https://www.facebook.com/nussc), and was a tutor for [CS1010: Programming Methodology](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1010/programming-methodology) and [CS2030: Programming Methodology 2](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2030/programming-methodology-ii) last year. I also train for endurance running during my free time.

## Looking for internship opportunities in 2020
I am open for summer internship from May to August 2020 (4 months).

I can be reached at: [evantay@comp.nus.edu.sg](mailto:evantay@comp.nus.edu.sg).
