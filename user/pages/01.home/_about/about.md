## Full-stack Cloud-enabled Software Engineer

Hi, I am a final year Computer Science undergraduate and Full-stack Cloud-enabled Software Engineer passionate about solving meaningful problems. I was a Software Engineer Intern at [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/) and a [Google Cloud Student Sprint Program](https://events.withgoogle.com/cssp/) participant previously.

I believe soft skills are just as important as technical competency. As a [Tutor for CS3103: Computer Networks Practice](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3103/computer-networks-practice), I conduct weekly labs for 17 students independently. As the [Deputy Head of Technology at Developer Student Club NUS](https://dscnustech.github.io), I co-organised and emceed for the first-ever Hack For Good hackathon.

I am also an [IMDA scholar (bond-free)](https://www.imda.gov.sg) who has received numerous academic and leadership awards. I was awarded the Colours Award for my contributions to the recreational sports scene as the [President of the NUS Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/).
