## Full-stack Cloud-enabled Software Engineer

Hi, I am a graduating Computer Science undergraduate passionate about solving Meaningful Problems. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities as a Cloud Engineer or Software Engineer starting from January 2021.

I was a Full-stack Software Engineer Intern at [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/) previously. I am also a [Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer](https://www.credential.net/a3645798-b27d-401a-a412-7f1c94ba7e6a) and [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/681b95e4-178e-4d95-af41-dcdc6dbb9442/public_url).

I believe soft skills are just as important as technical competency. As a [Tutor for CS3103: Computer Networks Practice](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3103/computer-networks-practice), I conduct weekly labs for 16 students independently. As the [Deputy Head of Tech at Google Developer Student Club NUS](https://dscnustech.github.io), I co-organised and emceed for Hack For Good 2020.

I am also an [IMDA scholar (bond-free)](https://www.imda.gov.sg) who has received numerous awards. I received the Colours Award for my contributions to the school sports scene as the [President of the NUS Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/).
