## Aspiring full-stack software engineer

Hi, I am a penultimate Computer Science undergraduate specialising in Network and Software Engineering who is passionate about solving meaningful problems as an aspiring Full-stack Software Engineer.

I am an [IMDA scholar (bond-free)](https://www.imda.gov.sg) who has received numerous academic and leadership awards. I was awarded the Colours Award for my contributions to the NUS recreational sports scene as the [President of the NUS Inline Skating Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusskating/?hl=en).

I believe social growth is just as important as academic development. As a [CS1010: Programming Methodology](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1010/programming-methodology) tutor, I conducted weekly 2-hour tutorial sessions for 14 students. As the current [Deputy Head of Technology of NUS's Google Developer Student Club](https://dscnustech.github.io), I oversee the execution of technical events organised by the club.

In my free time, I run, read and learn new things. The latest thing I picked up is the Udemy course: [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-e3c08245-a935-45b7-91da-6cc690f3dd30/?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email) which I completed in Feb 2020.
